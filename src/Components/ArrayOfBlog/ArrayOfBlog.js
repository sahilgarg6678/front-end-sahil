                Title : "The Enabot Ebo Air robot can entertain and provide security, but it’s not essential",
                Body : "Do you need a companion robot? These are the ones that tell jokes, remind you to take your medication, or allow you to communicate with family members who can’t drop in regularly. They don’t exactly replace human interaction, but rather facilitate it, with a friendly, non-threatening face that doesn’t trigger that uncanny valley feeling of revulsion or unease. I’m not entirely sure I need or want one. With a full house I’m usually trying to find time away from everyone rather than adding more people who demand my attention. But the Enabot Ebo Air has its uses. Thankfully devoid of humanoid features, the Ebo Air looks more like a Sphero, but with added tracks on the bottom to help it move around. It also has a small display that flashes up heart icons, a Wi-Fi symbol or a photo icon. If you have pets, for example, or children, the robot will be both entertainment and a way to stay in touch. And the company is billing it as a mobile security camera, complete with night vision and high-definition recording to its on-board micro-SD card that you can steer around the house, presumably in search of intruders, while you are out of the house or even out of the country thanks to its wifi connection. It does all this through the mobile app, which acts as a viewfinder for Ebo’s on-board camera, and allows you to communicate with people or pets in your home. If you are a lockdown pet owner it is one way for you to keep a close watch on your pet if you suddenly find yourself returning to the office. Obviously, it’s not a complete solution for those who are going to be out for eight hours at a time, but you can peek in every now and again or play with your pet while you are away. The dedicated pet mode means Ebo will roll out at regular intervals to play with your pet, tearing around the house with accompanying cute sound effects. As we don’t have any pets – apart from the fish, who are not Ebo’s target market – it mostly served as a companion for my children. After an initial period of suspicion, they found its antics hilarious and christened it ‘Bebop’. Most young children don’t have a very big attention span, unless you dangle a YouTube series of videos of other people unwrapping toys in front of them, so I wasn’t too sure how long Ebo would keep them occupied. I was pleasantly surprised. I used the pet settings, including the laser pointer feature I assume is meant for cats, to keep them occupied. While Ebo tore around our living room, spinning itself around in circles, they found it hilarious for far longer than I thought it would. It was also fun to roll Ebo out while I was elsewhere in the house to surprise a four-year-old trying to sneakily raid the biscuits. Because it’s relatively silent, the robot could sneak up on him and surprise him. Plus, I could record the footage, which was better quality than I thought it would be, for future use. Ebo can also track subjects, recognizing humans and pets, and following whichever one you select. When Ebo runs low on power it will take itself back to the dock, muttering ‘I’m going home to charge’ as it goes. When it can’t reach the dock, like all good robots it will alert you through the mobile app and you can solve the problem. Sometimes that is easier said than done, especially with the aforementioned four-year-old who has a mischievous streak a mile wide. Places I have found Ebo include random toyboxes in the playroom, a school backpack hung on the back of the door, under the sofa cushions in the living room, and once, memorably, in the fridge beside the milk. I swear the small heart shone with gratitude when I rescued it from that one.",

And the company is billing it as a mobile security camera, complete with night vision and high-definition recording to its on-board micro-SD card that you can steer around the house, presumably in search of intruders, while you are out of the house or even out of the country thanks to its wifi connection. It does all this through the mobile app, which acts as a viewfinder for Ebo’s on-board camera, and allows you to communicate with people or pets in your home. If you are a lockdown pet owner it is one way for you to keep a close watch on your pet if you suddenly find yourself returning to the office. Obviously, it’s not a complete solution for those who are going to be out for eight hours at a time, but you can peek in every now and again or play with your pet while you are away. The dedicated pet mode means Ebo will roll out at regular intervals to play with your pet, tearing around the house with accompanying cute sound effects. As we don’t have any pets – apart from the fish, who are not Ebo’s target market – it mostly served as a companion for my children. After an initial period of suspicion, they found its antics hilarious and christened it ‘Bebop’. Most young children don’t have a very big attention span, unless you dangle a YouTube series of videos of other people unwrapping toys in front of them, so I wasn’t too sure how long Ebo would keep them occupied. I was pleasantly surprised. I used the pet settings, including the laser pointer feature I assume is meant for cats, to keep them occupied. While Ebo tore around our living room, spinning itself around in circles, they found it hilarious for far longer than I thought it would. It was also fun to roll Ebo out while I was elsewhere in the house to surprise a four-year-old trying to sneakily raid the biscuits. Because it’s relatively silent, the robot could sneak up on him and surprise him. Plus, I could record the footage, which was better quality than I thought it would be, for future use. Ebo can also track subjects, recognizing humans and pets, and following whichever one you select. When Ebo runs low on power it will take itself back to the dock, muttering ‘I’m going home to charge’ as it goes. When it can’t reach the dock, like all good robots it will alert you through the mobile app and you can solve the problem. Sometimes that is easier said than done, especially with the aforementioned four-year-old who has a mischievous streak a mile wide. Places I have found Ebo include random toyboxes in the playroom, a school backpack hung on the back of the door, under the sofa cushions in the living room, and once, memorably, in the fridge beside the milk. I swear the small heart shone with gratitude when I rescued it from that one.",

                Body : "Have a 5G phone but don’t know when you will be able to put your phone’s capability to the best use? Worry no more as India could get 5G services as early as this year. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has confirmed that 5G services will launch in India in 2022. The DoT has also revealed that the 5G services will be made available in 13 Indian cities in the beginning. It will then be rolled out in remaining cities. ‘Costing Rs 224 crore, the project is likely to be completed by December 31, 2021, paving the way for end-to-end testing of 5G (/topic/5g) User Equipment’s (UEs) and network equipment by 5G (/topic/5g) stakeholders developing 5G (/topic/5g) products/services/use cases, including indigenous start-ups, SMEs, Academia and Industry in the country,’ DoT said in an official statement. The telecommunications department said that the 13 cities that will get 5G services include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Gandhinagar, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Jamnagar, Kolkata, Chennai, Lucknow, Pune, Delhi, and Mumbai. The DoT had previously said that it would complete the 5G project by December 31, 2021. Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had announced that the government is expected to hold the auction of the 5G spectrum, including airwaves, in early June. Post the auction, the government may finally start rolling out 5G services to people in the 13 cities in August and September this year. The DoT has not revealed which telecom operator among Jio, Vodafone and Airtel will roll out the 5G services first. However, all the three telecom operators are expected to launch their 5G services around the same time. As per reports, Jio, Airtel and even Vodafone have already set up their trial sites in the 13 cities that are expected to get 5G services. As per reports, Airtel and Jio have claimed to be the first operators to roll out 5G services in India. Airtel's Bharti Mittal has confirmed that the company’s 5G network is ready and it will roll out soon after the auction is completed. ‘Yes, you will get faster speeds but they will be there. There is a desire of the government to start 5G soon, right? As soon as the recommendations come and auctions happen, within months I would say you will have early 5G networks coming up and Airtel has been getting ready for the same,’ Mittal had told ET Telecom in an interview.",

                Title : "India is gearing up for a post-UPI digital payments revolution",
                Body : "There is a wide consensus in the financial world that India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is one of the biggest and most impactful financial technology innovations to have come out in the world. Most nations still do not have an equivalent or similar system for free and real-time interbank payments and a growing number of them are actively evaluating implementing UPI in their own jurisdictions.<br /> Now, two new fintech innovations from RBI are likely to even surpass UPI in their grassroot impact; bringing all the benefits and advantages of digital payments to a whole new class of users who do not have stable Internet at all times; or are feature phone users without any mobile Internet connectivity. According to a 2020 WEF report, nearly 700 million people in India are still unconnected, which translates to about 50% of the country’s population still not having internet access. <br />Early in January, the Reserve Bank of India released its framework to allow offline digital payments of up to ?200 per transaction with an overall limit of ?2,000. This framework allows digital payments to take place without Internet connectivity (offline mode), which is a huge boon for building greater trust in digital payments in remote, rural or semi-urban areas that often suffer from poor mobile Internet connectivity. <br />To protect consumer safety, RBI has not only set a reasonable limit, but also mandated that these transactions must be conducted only in face-to-face mode (in the presence of the account owner or beneficiary). However, they can still be made using any of the popular payment channels or modes including debit cards, wallets or mobile devices. As the transactions are offline, users will receive SMS or email alerts when they are connected to a network. Further, these transactions will not require an OTP or any other Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA). <br />In the case of smartphones, the offline digital payments could be enabled through an ‘on-device’ wallet inside the user’s favorite UPI app. Recall that in December last year, RBI had proposed to enable wallets in UPI apps specifically for low-value transactions, in order to conserve banks’ system resources, without any change in the transaction experience for the user.",

                Body : "Fast & Furious producer Neal Moritz explains how the franchise could look very different after the upcoming 10th and 11th films. Starting back in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious, the Fast & Furious franchise has now been going strong for over twenty years and holds ten films, including one spin-off movie, Hobbs and Shaw. The franchise, which stars Vin Diesel as street racer turned action hero Dominic Toretto, is renowned for its massive action sequences and elaborate car chases. Ahead of last year's release of F9: The Fast Saga, it was announced that the main franchise would end with the upcoming tenth film, which is to be split into two parts. Excitement is already building surrounding the upcoming Fast & Furious 10, which has recently added Jason Momoa to the cast as a villain, and Brie Larson in an unknown role. In addition to Diesel, Momoa, and Larson, much of the rest of the original Fast & Furious cast is expected to return, including Michelle Rodriguez, Nathalie Emmanuel, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang, Jordana Brewster, and John Cena. In a new interview on The Town with Matthew Belloni podcast, Moritz reveals what he would like to see for the Fast & Furious franchise following the conclusion of the Fast Saga. In a move that many might not expect, Moritz explains that he'd actually like to see the franchise become smaller and more contained instead of going bigger. Moritz says that he'd like to go back to the spirit of the original films. Check out Moritz's full comment below: As is often lovingly pointed out by fans, Fast & Furious started off as a franchise about street racing and now has cars flying between buildings and, in F9: The Fast Saga, even going into space. Each entry in the franchise currently seems to try to go bigger and bolder than the previous installment, which, eventually, will mean that the stakes simply can't go any higher. Although he does have a few thoughts about where Fast & Furious could go following the conclusion of the Fast Saga, Moritz stresses that, right now, his focus is to make sure the next installment is good, saying, Let's make a great movie and then we will figure out the next one. For many, some of the antics in the more recent Fast & Furious films are already too far beyond the realm of believability, making a move back to a more grounded street racing of the earlier films seem like a tantalizing proposition. It remains to be seen what will become of Dom and the rest of the crew in Fast & Furious 10, but it certainly sounds like the upcoming two installments will serve as a sendoff for the characters. With the Fast & Furious franchise potentially going smaller rather than bigger in the future, it might also be the perfect time to introduce a brand new cast of characters for audiences to root for.",

                Body : "Jaipur: American Airlines relaunched flights to India this week, nearly a decade after stopping them, looking to capitalise on growing demand for non-stop travel amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior executive of the airline told Reuters.        With travel demand bouncing back at home, American Airlines wants to expand its international network and India was 'one of the biggest untapped markets' for it, said Tom Lattig, managing director of EMEA sales. 'A lot of customers really want to fly non- stop, particularly as we've come through the pandemic. We know there is huge demand for travel between India and the United States so there is an opportunity right now in the middle of the pandemic to come back,' Lattig said in an interview in New Delhi.       American Airlines, which suspended services to India in 2012, started flying between New Delhi and New York on the weekend and will add flights between India's tech city of Bengaluru and Seattle in March.If it succeeds with those two routes, it will add services to India's financial capital of Mumbai, Lattig said.",
